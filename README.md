# Unbounded Peceptions

## Setup

This project can be setup by copying all the folders into 4.25 unreal project. It requires the plugin BLUI (because it uses some browser widgets I made in Svelte), and it also uses some random EGS assets, although all the assets are cosmetic. I'm also not very good at making things look in the engine so I just randomly used many visuals from Infinity Blade, Soul City, and The Open World Demo Collection.

There's also some assets I grabbed online randomly like a random miku model. I will never use these assets for monetary purposes, it is all just a placeholder that looks funny and will be replaced in the future.

This project used to leverage the Tensorflow plugin, but it never worked out in my packaged game, so I removed it. I still left the scripts up to see because they may work in version 4.23. I'm also not working too much on Machine Learning anymore.

To see some of the features the game offers you can read the TestLevelDesign document. These features are in the game, although not all of them are tested nor are all of them shown in the test level so they may not be working at this point. However most of the features are working.

## Extras

As an added bonus I included some drawings in the extra folder, and two themes I use. One is in visual studio, and I use a nice dark blue picture with it. The is a UE4 theme. It took me a long time
to customize those so enjoy.

My other project on Github is a Dialog tool for this game (at https://github.com/cyphina/DialogTool). It might be kind of jank since I haven't touched it in a while but I checked it out and it works for sure. It just an app to visually create dialog graphs and then export the data which we have to paste into our dialog JSON table.

## Play the demo online

You can play a demo online at https://cyphina.itch.io/unbounded-perceptions
There's something wrong with the cursors in the packaged build. I change the hard cursor when hovering over different types of objects but it doesn't show atm. Will fix that maybe in a while because I'm
gonna study some stuff for a bit. Just imagine the cursors changing to the ones inside Content/Slate whenever you hover over a different type object you can interact with.

## Next steps

I kind of need to find some other work now so I may put development on hold. I'll still be working on my story and such. I'll focus on building a website for myself and maybe upload the story there. I'll also work on another app this time maybe to make quests. Maybe I'll make it so the quest app could be used on mobile.
