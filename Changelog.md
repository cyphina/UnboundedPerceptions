# Working on a boss part 3
* Renamed a bunch more assets to easily find them
* Various bugfixes
    * Fixed one issue around select rect (one issue still around where you can select an enemy and then select rect the other allies)
    * Fixed some issues revolving around some abilities/effects that I screwed up (like the stun effect)
* Refactored a shit ton of BT decorator, generator, context, and query codes.
* Added some new things for the above BT stuff as well.
* --- In the process of removing the blackboard completely (I probably won't need it till later so don't want to worry about misusing it.) ---
