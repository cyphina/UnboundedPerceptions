# QOL Fixes after Itch
* Fixed camera control being dependent upon framerate
* Added setting camera bounds to levels
* Fixed some other QOL Stuff
* Added some fixes that could be useful if porting the game to MP (this can definately occur in the future since I am more comfortable with it).
    * I'll probably add a new branch for this later, for now this just fixes how somethings are organized and has server/client code checks so that the game runs (albeit non-functional in listen server mode).
