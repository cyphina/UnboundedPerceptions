Fixed not being able to target enemy behind invisible enemies due to tracing stopping at inivisble enemies
Allowed us to transition to next level with units being dead
Added some unit highlighting when mouse cursor is hovered (needs post process effects to be enabled)
Fixed problem with cursor not resetting after cast due to glitches introduced with the unit highlighting
Fixed up AOE self cast targetting
Fixed unable to target units with their collision cylindars hidden
Fixed enemy bullets shooting at the ground
Set standard attacks to be nonelemental by default to prevent crashing with ranged attacks
Added some various animations
Added extra code to shooter enemy to allow it to handle homing and dumbfire projectiles
Fixed crashes due to null references when checking the target which has been deleted to see if we can keep attacking it due to visibility

Added a chasing state
Added an attack move behavior option
Added quickcast and quick attack move
Refactored some input code in CameraPawn due to moving hiding AOE indicator inside spell targetting function
Changed some instances of ChangeCursor that was trying to reset the secondary cursor bool but never actually did to SetSecondaryCursor()

Changed ResourceManager name to RTSResourceManager so I could upgrade code to 4.22
Also moved code from Posesss() to OnPosess()
Added white cursor highlighting to NPCS
Fixed issue with loading restoring game values before loading up structs from loaded binary array
Added collision profiles for interactables that can be walked through and walls that should have raycasting pass through them.
Fixed up some constructors (NPC, Ally, Enemy, and respective controllers) to clean up BP subclassing
Added dynamic behavior tree options for enemies, so their navigation around the map can be different from when they are battling
Removed fade effect manipulating collision.  I think that I'll let the player have more responsibility controlling the camera to see behind walls, although when the heroes get near we'll fade out the walls.
Fixed up gravity on start level by splitting up unit default location, and making sure default gravity was set to 0 in component (not just from the setenable call since it runs on a delay which will not prevent the units from accelerating downards)
Added crappy attack animations and blended them in with movement (for robot)
Fixed issue in quests where the 4.22 updated the function ParseIntoArray() to take in the new parameter indicating the number of delimeters.  It moved the empty culling to the fourth parameter, which screwed the parsing.
Removed transient modifier from items in datatable (forgot why that was there but it screwed me over for a while)
Fixed units having correct collision at the start (relies on visibility so units with visibility on for debugging purposes is a problem)

Added Lifesteal effect
Added Insatiable Hunger Spell
Added Ice Bullet Spell
Added Enrage Spell
Fixed IronMaiden spell
ALL THESE SPELLS MY NEED MORE FIXING

Added health as a stat to be captured when dealing damage (so we can do damage based on max hp of source or target)
Fixed damagestruct to capture health as a stat so we weren't doing massive damage scaling on our health without us setting it

Refactored input functions names inside APawn
Changed Equip and Spell Menu combat opening functionality (now they don't block UI when they are opened)
Add delay on changing equipment
Changed vision tracing inside RTSGameState to be traces by channel
Removed Vision Channel 
Added a toggle for fading 
Fade now prevents objects from being clicked on but it can be toggled with Z
Removed previous functionality bound to Z key in CPC (Debugging Level Move/XP Gain)
Added messages when toggling fade on/off
Added messages when toggling camera pan lock on/off

Added chatbox UI
Added some stuff for using BERT to order commands needs the preprocessing steps to be fixed
Next up is to add the commands in game
