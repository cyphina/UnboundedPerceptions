Fixed tab indexing when a unit dies
Fixed cursor issue (accidentally toggled wrong setting in my controller class | KEEP THE CURSOR VISIBLE FLAG ON)
Fixed more threading issues for vision
Resized the browser sidebar again (my updated animation changes broke it)...
Created a delay during level transition to fix data races (not a guaranteed fix but its more optimal than using an extra lock
but it is not guaranteed to work with hundreds of units).
