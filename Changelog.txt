Added in some custom editor details when editing FTriggerData in the level editor or blueprints. Still a WIP to make it functional for all trigger types
Linked some properties between the custom details and FTriggerData struct (only for HUD changing trigger so far)
Made TriggerType and HUD enums iterable (via TEnumRange)
Added extra count value to those enums as well
Removed some unnecessary classes
Added patrol components to the allies
Moved StopAutomation() to unit controller class
Added some extra checking in some places
Stops behavior trees on 
Changed AttackMove task to AttackWhileMoving and invalidated the periodic attack timer
Renamed HelpText folder to HelpUI and had to rename its usage in ActionSlot
Added new widget for rebinding keys (it moves the orders of the keys and I'm not sure how to prevent that (Well I know of ways but they are inefficient so we'll leave it as so for now))
Moved widget logic for break menu to C++ and added way to navigate to key remapping widget
Deleted some older assets from systems I no longer use
Deleted some older code files that were for testing
Removed some unecessary code in random spots...
Set a default value for id field in FMyItemInfo
Moved quick cast logic to pawn
Renamed spelling errors inside Unit
Used some string_view in certain places where copying large strings could be a problem
Fixed being unable to right click under allied units

How to handle attack move queueing? (using patrol in which case we need to stop the tree once we move to the destination however we don't want to do this when not queueing)
