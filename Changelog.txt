Fixed shooting enemy not having a default projectile set in factory
Fixed crash when displaying a dead unit's effect bar
Dialog node parsers can now handle line breaks of the form \r\n
Fixed the homing ability of projectiles
Fixed ranged enemy shooting bullet at ground
Added projectile blocking walls
Added some collision profiles to better organize ally and enemy collision.  
Added a collision object type just for our vision spheres (profile name Vision)
AOE spells now target the right units instead of hitting friendlies and enemies
Fixed spells that need different targetting schemes depending on if an ally or enemy casts them (HealBullet, Firestorm, Healing Circle, etc.)
Changed DPRS to DRPS (Damage Recieved Per Second)
Added some extra features to disable when calling SetEnabled for a unit.  Customized what is disabled per class
Modified what things occur in the Die Function
Removed references to a hero leftover from the ally array and ally vision set when changing the party
Added an exploding enemy that can be pushed around
Added an endgame screen and updated pawn to stop taking input when the screen is reached
Fixed casting one spell on a hero causing another hero which was casting a spell to recast his/her spell
Added functionality for Seinen Departure and Cloak I spells.  Modified their values in data table 
Added an invisibility gameplay effect and cues
Fixed null references in enemyList in vision set in RTSGameState due to references in the set being deleted when the enemies are destroyed due to the level switch (added the cleanup in EndPlay)
Fixed explosion not calling Die() when suiciding, but just getting destroyed without leaving anything. 
Fixed cursor hovering over enemies indicating where they are when they are out of the vision sphere.  Left it for interactables since there are bright maps (maps where everything is pretty much visible) 
Fixed targetted actions (spell casting/attacking/item usage) on invisible units (cursor targetting click check) and untargettable units
Fixed enemies being able to target invisible allies without true sight
Also fixed glitch abusing leftover target data when using an item on an invisible unit to bypass target AI blueprint conditional checks.  Handled with changes to handling invisible unit in parent CastSpell(), since item usage is just a spell casting wrapper.
Fix enemy not visible when loading level (delayed visibility check in MyEnemy blueprint).  Still need a good solution to initializing enemy visibility before adding it to the C++ code.
Fixed heroes (loaded in the background) falling during the main menu
Fixed glitch with new unit turn rate system not taking into account that spells can be casted on interactables (like unlock)
Fixed AOE targetted spells targetting location too high (and then the caster couldn't reach the targetLocation) due to the trace hitting higher up on a big enemy
Fixed AOE targetting spells actual cast location (depending on unit or ground target)
Fixed projectile class pushing caster back when it is spawned too close
Fixed single target spells not following unit targets and interactable targets
Changed AOE spells cast targetting so it follow single target units if a unit was targetted
